Create a web-front end running on a node.js server where one can type in a search term and get a list of recent tweets containing that term.

Bonus Points:
* Add a cool looking frontend (Aurelia!)
* Running this on public cloud infrastructure of your choice
* Use a popular noSQL database to store tweets and retrieve them from there instead of Twitter
* Add some visualization about the content of the tweets
* Sentiment analysis of the results
* Use frontend framework where it makes sense
* Hybrid cloud : combine some components on public cloud and some components on private on-prem infrastructure
* App should look good on mobile screens as well as regular laptop screens (e.g 1080p)
* Components should run within Docker containers
* Containers should be deployed and orchestrated by the most popular open source orchestration system for containers
